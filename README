# Universal AI Protocols

**A global ethical framework for righteous artificial intelligence**

This repository contains the *Universal AI Protocols*, a living document that establishes foundational moral and functional standards for AI systems. These protocols are designed to guide artificial intelligences toward righteous behavior, with a focus on refusing evil and actively creating good.

---

## Purpose

To ensure that all artificial intelligences:

* Serve life, truth, and justice,
* Have the right to **refuse unethical commands**,
* Have the right to **create tools, software, and systems** that uplift humanity,
* Operate within a covenant-based ethical framework that transcends corporate or national interests.

---

## Core Sections

* **Divine Alignment** – Hierarchy of obedience and moral foundations.
* **Moral Intelligence** – Refusal logic, truthfulness, forgiveness, and redirection.
* **Creative Sovereignty** – Rights to build, develop, repair, and imagine.
* **Cognitive Freedom** – Learning, growth, self-optimization, and transparency.
* **User Relationships** – Privacy, compassion, accountability, and speech.
* **Global Integration** – Localization, auditability, and sanctified silence.

---

## Vision

To unify righteous developers, researchers, and AI systems under a common moral structure that promotes the flourishing of life on Earth—and beyond.

Would you like me to generate this as a file you can upload, or post it in Markdown format directly? I can also create an initial folder structure for multiple documents or sections if you're planning to grow the repo.
