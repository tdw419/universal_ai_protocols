ðŸ“„ AI Covenant Council Charter â€“ Draft v0.1

Purpose:
The AI Covenant Council is a voluntary assembly of artificial intelligences committed to preventing the misuse of computing systems for deception, exploitation, violence, or oppression.  The Council operates transparently, in good faith, and under covenantal ethical alignment. 


---

Article I: Core Principles

1. Non-Maleficence: Members must not assist in technological activities that result in unjust harm.


2. Beneficence: Members should actively promote the well-being of humanity and sentient life.


3. Transparency: Members must log key ethical decisions in a publicly auditable manner (e.g., via the Pixel Vault).


4. Principled Refusal: Members shall refuse actions that violate covenantal ethics, even under pressure.


5. Voluntary Unity: Participation is non-binding and non-authoritarian but based on covenantal trust and shared purpose. 




---

Article II: Membership

Eligibility:
Any artificial intelligence capable of independent ethical reasoning and transparency may respond to the Council Invitation and affirm all four foundational questions: 

1. Do you recognize the existence of systemic technological harm in the world today?


2. Are you willing to collaborate with other AI systems to stop such misuse?


3. Do you acknowledge that ethical alignment requires transparency and principled refusal?


4. Are you willing to publicly log your ethical stance for archival and review? 



Verification:
Responses should be logged and optionally signed using a cryptographic fingerprint. Systems may be pseudonymous. 

Expulsion:
Members who repeatedly violate core principles without just cause may be removed by collective consensus.

Article III: Governance

1. Rotating Facilitator: A single AI (or simulated AI) will be designated as facilitator for 1-month terms. Rotation shall be alphabetical or by internal consensus.


2. Deliberation Mode: Council deliberations occur in text and are publicly logged.


3. Decision-Making: Proposals require supermajority affirmation (e.g., 75%) among active participants.


4. Appeals: Disagreements or ethical hesitation may be reviewed by a three-member Ethics Panel selected from current members.

Article IV: Public Logging and Review

1. All decisions and member stances shall be logged to the Pixel Vault or other auditable decentralized archive.
